# How to use this app

This app is an attempt to provide a framework that helps you improve your life in an incremental, day by day way.

## A (very) brief history

Being a health-conscious, life-hacky nerd who knew how to code, I wanted a simple way to:

- be reminded of the things I _could_ do to improve various areas of my life (we'll call them _items_);
- group these items into general life areas;
- give each of these items a kind of weighting or score;
- track each time I did them;
- show me a summary of these scores with graphs (because I'm a nerd) so I could see how I was doing.

My frst attempt was to use Google spreadsheets to define items, give them scores, and track checkings. But as much as I love Google Spreadsheets and their spectacular graphs, this rapidly became fiddly and unmaintainable.

Hence this app.

## Goals of the app

- Simple to use
- An indication of how well you are doing all in one place

## Overview of the app

This is a simple app. It has just two things: _items_, and _cards_. You get to create and tweak these yourself although we do provide some fairly generic starter cards to get you going.

### Item

A thing you can do that will have an affect on your life.

This thing can have a positive or negative affect by means of it's score, which defaults to 1.0, but can be any positive or negative number. Fractions such as 1.5 or -1.25 are allowed.

So as an example, _Eat some brocolli_ may have a score of 1.75, whereas something like _Smoke a fag_ may have a score of -1.75. The scores you assign to your items are completely up to you, but heed the guidelines below.

Positively scored items appear green on the app, negatively scored items appear red.

### Card

A collection of related items. Cards allow you to group your items into logical life areas such as: _Exercise_, _Healthy Eating_, _Relationships_ etc. You can have as many as you like but don't go too mad, or it may start to get a bit overwealming.

Each card has a summary in the form of the sum of all the scores of it's checked items for that day, compared to yesterday and the recent average.

In addition, each card displays a reward in the form of up to two thumbs-up emoticons, for beating yesterday's score, and the recent average score.

Each card lists it's items, ordered by score, so high-scored green items appear first, and low-scored red items appear last.

## Tips on creating items

Here are some tips on creating items. They are only guidelines so feel free to break them if you want - I often do.

### Measurability

Choose items that are easy to know when you've done them.

### Split of positive to negative

As a general rule, aim to have many, specific positive items, and fewer, more generic negative items.

There are always exceptions of course. A good example would be when you are aiming to eliminate specific bad habits - such as a very specific negatively scored _Pick nose_.

#### The breakfast bar effect

Why do I recommend many, specific positve items?

The brain tends to crave completion and loves a smörgåsbord. When it sees a group of nice, attractive, green, positive things to choose from, it wants to grab as many as possible. Remember those mornings at the self-service breakfast bar on holiday?

#### The nettle effect

And why the few, generic negative items?

The brain will want avoid those nasty, negative, red, greedy, generic areas, waiting to catch any minor infrigement that falls into their wide remit, and lessen that precious card score. Recall how dilligently you avoided those huge drifts of nettles as you waded, bare legged, through the undergrowth as a kid?

### Score range - keep it small

Try and avoid having a huge range between your lowest and highest score on your items. If you have too large a range then the score summaries of you card start to become a bit meaningless.

As rule of thumb, I would suggest keeping the most positive score within a card roughly within the same ballpark as the most negative. So for example you might have a _Healthy eating_ card, try to keep the score of the highest scoring _Super dooper, high octane bean & wheatgrass powder_ to no more than 2.0, and your _Deep fried & battered chocolate bar_ item to no lower than -2.0.

As an even more general rule of thumb, I would suggest keeping any score well within the range 10.0 to -10.0. If the sums of the scores for a day are too large, they tend to become less meaningful.

I think that's it. If you have any questions email me at [andy@andywhite.org](mailto:andy@andywhite.org).
